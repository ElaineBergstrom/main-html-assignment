  <p>
    My name is Elaine, and I have a slight obsession with dogs, specifically corgi's. 
    <br>
    I grew up with a Pembroke Corgi which probably began my obsession with the breeds. 
    <br>
    Since her passing when I was around 8 years old, I vowed to have my own one day.
    <br>
    Two years ago we brought home our own Cardigan corgi named Alfie. 
    <br>
    He is the bestest of boys... also the loudest.
