    What are corgi's?
  </h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      Corgi's are a dog often recognized for their short legs and 
      long bodies similar to that of a Dachshund. 
      <br> However there are actually two different breeds of corgi:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Welsh Cardigan Corgi
        <a href="./cardigan.html">
          <img 
            src="../images/cardigan.jpg" 
            alt="Image of a brindled colored welsh cardigan corgi dog."
            width="300"
            height="200"
          >
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Welsh Pembroke Corgi
        <a href="./pembroke.html">
          <img src="../images/pembroke.jpg" alt="A red colored pembroke corgi dog standing proudly.">
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both breeds were bred for cattle herding in Wales, their short legs helped them to avoid
      being kicked by cows while herding. <br> They were also used as watch dogs and for hunting. Both 
      are excellent family dogs, smart and easy to train, but require <br> a medium amount of physical 
      and mental stimulation to stay happy. <br>It should also be noted they are a talkative breed and if 
      you are looking for a quiet breed this is probably not the one for you.
